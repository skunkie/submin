We are sorry that you want to remove Submin. We hope it could
help you, and if not, please let us know why.

REMOVAL INSTRUCTIONS
====================

Submin consists of several parts that all need to be removed:
1) the executables and libraries
2) the environment (you might want to back this up because it
   contains the repositories and possibly bug tracking info)
3) Apache configuration

We'll start with 3 and work our way backwards, since that is
a nicer way to clean up things.

The instructions assume that you installed submin into
/var/lib/submin (default location). If you used a different
location, please substitute that in the instructions below.

Cleaning up Apache configuration
--------------------------------

This depends on how you configured apache: there are multiple
ways of doing it. If you used Quickstart, look for symlinks
to /var/lib/submin/conf/apache-*.conf in /etc/apache2/conf.d
and remove them.

If you did a manual configuration you can also look for
symlinks in /etc/apache2/conf.d or look for Includes to your
submin environment. For example:

   grep -Rn "Include.*/var/lib/submin" /etc/apache2

Remove any Includes.

Finally, check your configuration and restart:

    apachectl configtest && apachectl restart

Removing your submin environment
--------------------------------

Now we can remove the submin environment. If you do not want
to save any repositories or bug tracking information, just
delete everything:

    rm -rf /var/lib/submin

If you do want to save repositories or bug tracking information,
first move them out of the way:

    mkdir /backup
    mv /var/lib/submin/{svn,trac} /backup

If you used svn and git, use {svn,git,trac} below, or if you
only used git, use {git}. You'll get the idea.

Removing executable and libraries
--------------------------------

If you installed submin using debian packages, the only
thing you have to do now is:

    aptitude purge submin2

This will remove all executables and libraries and purge
any configuration.

If you used the "python setup.py" method, you should find the files by yourself
and delete them. They should be located in python's site-packages and some
binaries in /usr/bin/ (look for submin*). Alternatively, you could try to
reinstall with the --record to get a list of files to remove, as suggested in:
