Configuration
=============

Most configuration can be set by using submin2-admin. For more information
run 'submin2-admin /path/to/submin/env help'.


Submin2-admin config set
------------------------

A list of submin2-admin 'config' options is given here, since submin2-admin
does not have a complete list (if it's not set, it's not shown). The default
values and examples are shown within quotes to clarify what is part of the
value. Don't use the quotes when setting the value.

For example, to set 'base_url_submin' to "/submin", use the following command:

    submin2-admin /path/to/submin/env config set base_url_submin /submin


Options:

 * apache_server_info_url
    Only set this when you are really sure what you are doing. This URL is
    used when 'apachectl' (or variants) can not list the apache modules for
    diagnostics purposes. You can find this list of modules in the Diagnostics
    menu when logged in as an administrator, under Subversion checks.

 * auth_type
    The storage used for authentication and others. Currently, only "sql"
    is supported.

 * base_url_git
    The base url after the hostname (see http_vhost). The default value is
    "/git". Git support need to be enabled for this to work (see INSTALL).

 * base_url_submin
    The base url after the hostname (see http_vhost) used for submin itself.
    The default value is "/submin".

 * base_url_svn
    The base url after the hostname (see http_vhost) used for subversion
    access. The default value is "/svn".

 * base_url_trac
    The base url after the hostname (see http_vhost) user for Trac. This is
    only used when trac support is enabled. The default value is '/trac'.

 * commit_email_from
    Commit emails are sent from this address.
    Example: "Submin <submin@supermind.nl>"

 * database_version
    For internal use. Do not change.

 * dir_bin
    Deprecated.

 * enabled_trac
    Set to "yes" if Trac support is enabled (this enables e.g. options in the
    web interface. Set to "no" if Trac support is not necessary.

 * env_path
    The PATH environment variable. This can be changed to find helper scripts.
    Example: "/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/bin"

 * git_dir
    The directory where git repositories are stored. If path start with a "/",
    then the directory is absolute. If it does not start with a slash, it's
    relative to the submin environment (default /var/lib/submin). If you do not
    let submin handle it, you might get problems with permissions. The default
    value of git_dir is: "git".

 * git_ssh_host
    The hostname to expose to the outside for git repositories.
    Example: "git.example.org"

 * git_ssh_host_internal
    The hostname to use internally for git. This should end up in the same
    account as when connecting to git_ssh_host. Defaults to: "localhost".

 * git_ssh_port
    The port to connect to for git. The same port is used for external as
    internal use. Default: "22"

 * git_user
    The ssh-user used for git-access, both external as internal.
    Default: "git"

 * http_vhost
    The hostname to use when the hostname can not be guessed (e.g. in e-mails).
    If the scheme is not included, it is prepended with 'http://'. If you want
    to run only on HTTPS, prepend 'https://' yourself.
    Example: "https://example.org".

 * session_salt
    For internal use. Do not change.

 * smtp_from
    Submin e-mails (e.g. password resets) are sent from this address. Please
    set this to a sane value. Default: "root@localhost"

 * smtp_hostname
    Hostname to connect to when sending e-mails. By default this is
    "localhost". If Submin can not connect, it will try locally with a
    'sendmail'-like binary.

 * smtp_port
    Port to connect to when sending e-mails. Default is 25. See also
    smtp_hostname.

 * smtp_username, smtp_password
    Username and password used to connect to smtp_hostname on port smtp_port
    when sending e-mails. See also smtp_hostname.

 * svn_authz_file
    The location of the svn authz file. If you are really sure you want to
    change this, please regenerate apache config files, since it needs to
    update the location as well (see INSTALL for instructions). For discussion
    about absolute/relative paths, see 'git_dir'.
    Default: "conf/authz"

 * svn_dir
    The directory where subversion repositories are stored. For more
    information see discussion at 'git_dir'. The default is "svn".

 * trac_dir
    The directory where Trac repositories are stored. For more information see
    discussion at 'git_dir'. The default is "trac".

 * vcs_plugins
    Which version control system plugins to load. Can be "svn", "git" or both.
    Default: "git,svn"
