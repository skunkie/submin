How to import existing authz and svn repositories into submin
-------------------------------------------------------------

We are going to create a fake submin1.2 installation and then use the 'convert'
method of submin2 to import our data. Just follow these 7 easy steps:

1) Copy your authz file to /tmp/authz (or somewhere else) and add a new group:
'submin-admins'. This group was used in submin1.2 to determine admin users.
Add to this group all users that you want to give admin privileges to. You can
choose to give users admin privileges later as well.

2) Create a configuration file called '/tmp/bootstrap.conf':

-----------8<----- /tmp/bootstrap.conf ----------------
[svn]
access_file = /path/to/current/htpasswd
userprop_file = /dev/null
authz_file = /tmp/authz
repositories = /path/to/current/subversion/repositories
-----------8<----- /tmp/bootstrap.conf ----------------

3) Make sure you have working backups of the files/directories
mentioned above. Submin2 will not touch the htpasswd file and the authz file,
but it will use the repositories (that is, it will not make a copy, but it
will point to this directory).

The repositories are not copied, so submin2 will use this directory as well. If
you want to move them later, see MOVING SUBVERSION DIRECTORY below.

4) Run the following command to initialize submin2 (and import users/groups):

  submin2-admin /var/lib/submin convert /tmp/bootstrap.conf

This will create the submin2 environment in /var/lib/submin (change it if you
don't like it). Apache configuration is created (see the messages on screen).

5) Include the apache config file into your webserver (or make a symlink from a
conf.d directory).

6) Remove /tmp/bootstrap.conf and /tmp/authz

7) Enjoy submin :)


Moving subversion directory (optional)
--------------------------------------

If you want to move your repositories to /var/lib/submin/svn (the default), you
have to update the configuration as well. The following command will show all
the configuration:

  submin2-admin /var/lib/submin config get

To change the svn repository directory, run this command:

  submin2-admin /var/lib/submin config set svn_dir svn

This will set the svn_dir to /var/lib/submin/svn ('svn' is relative to
'/var/lib/submin', so it will become '/var/lib/submin/svn').

Now your webserver does not know where to find the subversion repositories. If
you are using apache, you can use the 'apacheconf' to update the configuration
(example is for cgi, for wsgi replace 'cgi' with 'wsgi'):

  cd /var/lib/submin &&
  submin2-admin . apacheconf create cgi ./conf/apache.cgi.conf

Now reload your apache and you should be done!
