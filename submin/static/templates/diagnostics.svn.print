[@test:!diag.svn_apache_modules_exec_ok
 * Apache modules: fail
   Could not execute apachectl or load the server-info URL to test if modules
   are loaded. Error message was:

----- BEGIN ERROR MESSAGE ---
[val diag.svn_apache_modules_errmsg]
----- END ERROR MESSAGE ---

   If the above commands all fail with 'No such file or directory', then maybe
   the 'apachectl' binary is named differently on your system. Please report
   this as a bug.

   If the above commands can be found, but fail to verify because 'apachectl'
   complains about lack of permissions, you can make sure that the apache
   module 'info' is loaded and reachable from localhost. Submin will then try
   to get the list of modules from the 'info' modules by retrieving a URL.

   By default, this URL is 'http://localhost/server-info?list', but if you
   need to change it for some reason, you can do so with the following command:

     submin2-admin [val subminenv] config set apache_server_info_url "http://localhost/server-info?list"

   If the 'internal URL get' fails this URL could not be used, please check
   the error message there and try to correct the error.
