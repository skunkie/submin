Trac support working correctly: [val diag.trac_all_label]
 * Trac enabled: [val diag.enabled_trac_label]
[@test:diag.enabled_trac
   To disable, run the following command:

     submin2-admin [val subminenv] config set enabled_trac no

]
[@else
   To enable, run the following command:

     submin2-admin [val subminenv] config set enabled_trac yes

]
[@test:diag.enabled_trac
 * Trac installed: [val diag.installed_trac_label]
[@test:!diag.installed_trac
   The 'trac-admin' command was not found, please install Trac. If you have
   installed Trac, but it cannot be found, check if the env_path config value
   is set correctly:

     submin2-admin [val subminenv] config get env_path

   Set it with:

     submin2-admin [val subminenv] config set env_path <yourpath>

]
 * Trac dir set in config: [val diag.trac_dir_set_label]
[@test:!diag.trac_dir_set
   To set the trac_dir, run the following command:

     submin2-admin [val subminenv] config set trac_dir trac

]
 * Trac sync configured: [val diag.trac_acl_hook_label]
[@test:!diag.trac_acl_hook
   The variable 'acl_hook' has not been set. It probably works on the defaults,
   but leaving it unconfigured can cause slow down during commits because of
   DNS resolving if trac sync is enabled. We recommend setting the ACL like
   this:

     submin2-admin [val subminenv] config set acl_hook "[val diag.trac_acl_hook_recommendation]"

]
 * Trac sync accessible: [val diag.trac_sync_access_label]
[@test:!diag.trac_sync_access
   Git hook does not have access to submin to sync trac.
   Please make sure that the IP-address is in the ACL. Set it with:

     submin2-admin [val subminenv] config set acl_hook "[val diag.trac_acl_hook_recommendation]"

   The error message was:

----- BEGIN ERROR MESSAGE ---
[val diag.trac_sync_access_msg]
----- END ERROR MESSAGE ---

 * htpasswd export directory exists: [@test:diag.trac_htpasswd_file [val diag.trac_htpasswd_dir_exists_label]
[@test:!diag.trac_htpasswd_dir_exists
   The setting htpasswd_file is set, but the directory does not exist. To
   export the htpasswd_file, please make sure that [val diag.trac_htpasswd_dir] exists.

]
][@else [val diag.trac_htpasswd_file_label]
   The setting htpasswd_file is not set. We will not export an htpasswd file
   for trac. If you don't use tracd for running your trac-environment you are
   probably fine. Otherwise, please point htpasswd_file to the proper location
   for your password file.

]
 * Trac environments connected: [val diag.trac_envs_all_connected_label]
[@test:!diag.trac_envs_all_connected
   The following Trac environments are orphaned:
[iter:diag.trac_envs_orphaned
    - [ival]
]
   No repository is found that connects to them (should be the same name as
   the trac name). Maybe it is the result of a deleted repository?

]
 * Trac environments config: [val diag.trac_envs_complete_label]
[@test:!diag.trac_envs_complete
   The following Trac environments have missing/incorrect configuration.
   Please correct the values to the one below:

[iter:diag.trac_envs_missing_config
    - [ival.trac_env] ([val diag.trac_base_url][val ival.trac_env]/admin/general/plugin#no1)
      [iter:ival.missing_configs \[[ikey]\] [iter:ival [test:ival.fatal  no ][else warn] [ival.option] = [ival.value]]]

      The trac.ini file is: "[val diag.trac_dir]/[ival.trac_env]/conf/trac.ini"
]

   Options from the 'components' section can be enabled in its Trac admin panel
   (Trac may ask you to login first). Other options have to be configured in
   the trac.ini of the corresponding trac environment.]
