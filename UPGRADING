Upgrading from 1.2
------------------

 IMPORTANT: by default, 'submin2-admin convert' does *not* copy subversion
 repositories or trac environments, so do *NOT* throw them away after the
 conversion. You might want to move the directories into /var/lib/submin/.
 If you want to do that, see 'Moving SVN and Trac dirs' below. 

Submin 2 is configured differently from Submin 1.2. The latter has a config file
in /etc/submin/ (e.g. default.conf), and repositories in /var/lib/submin/svn. Submin2 has one directory, /var/lib/submin where everything is located (config, svn, trac, git).

To initialize a Submin 2 environment from 1.2, run this command:

    submin2-admin /var/lib/submin convert /etc/submin/submin1.2.conf

where /var/lib/submin does NOT exist yet and where /etc/submin/submin1.2.conf is
the old configuration. This command will convert the (flat file) config of
Submin 1.2 and copy the information to an SQLite database, located in 
/var/lib/submin/conf/submin.db. Also, permissions are set and a couple of apache
configuration files are created in /var/lib/submin/conf.

To include the newly created apache config, remove the old configuration (it
will overlap with the newly created apache conf, since we copied the
configuration), and run the following command:

    ln -s /var/lib/submin/conf/apache.cgi.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/submin2.conf

This will select the CGI version.


Git Support
-----------

Submin 2 has git support. To enable it, run this command as root and follow
the instructions on screen:

    submin2-admin /var/lib/submin git init


Moving SVN and Trac dirs
------------------------

Since 'convert' leaves the Subversion and trac directories where they are, they
are still at their old place after the 'convert'. To import them as well, copy
(instead of move; in case something goes wrong) them to your new environment
(e.g. /var/lib/submin/). After copying the directories, change the location in
the configuration as well:

    submin2-admin /var/lib/submin config set svn_dir /var/lib/submin/svn
    submin2-admin /var/lib/submin config set trac_dir /var/lib/submin/trac

Then, create the apache2 config again and reload apache2:

    submin2-admin /var/lib/submin apacheconf create
    apachectl reload

If this doesn't work, you can check the config (and/or follow the instructions
in the error messages):

    submin2-admin /var/lib/submin config get


Happy subminning!
